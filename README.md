Student Scores Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes student performance by processing a CSV file containing their scores across multiple subjects. It calculates the average score for each student, identifies the top performer, and visualizes the results in a clear and informative bar chart.

Key Features:

Load and clean data: Reads student scores from a CSV file, handling missing data by filtering or filling missing values.

Calculate averages: Computes the average score per student across all subjects.

Identify top students: Finds the student(s) with the highest average score.

Visualize results: Generates a bar chart displaying each studentâ€™s average score, making it easy to compare performances at a glance.

Export plot: Saves the visualization as an image that can be embedded in reports or GitHub README files.

Why this matters:

Understanding student performance helps educators tailor instruction and identify areas needing improvement. This automated analysis simplifies reviewing large datasets, providing quick insights through both numerical and visual summaries.
